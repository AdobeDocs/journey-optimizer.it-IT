# Creare le raccolte {#create-collections}

Collections allows you to organize your offers by regrouping them into categories of your choice. You can, for example, create a &quot;sport&quot; collection that will contain sport-related offers only.

You can create two types of collections:

* **** These collections are updated automatically. For example, if a new offer is created with the selected tag, it will automatically be added to the collection.

* **** The collection can only be updated by manually adding more offers to it.

To create a collection, follow these steps:

1. **[!UICONTROL Collections]****[!UICONTROL Create collection]**

1. Specify the name and type of collection to create.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Static collections are not updated automatically. To add offers to a static collection, you need to edit it and add them manually.

1. Once the collection is created, it displays in the list. You can select it to edit or delete it.
